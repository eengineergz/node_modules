'development' : 'production',\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      // ... other rules\n      {\n        test: /\\.[jt]sx?$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          // ... other loaders\n          {\n            loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),\n            options: {\n              // ... other options\n              plugins: [\n                // ... other plugins\n                isDevelopment && require.resolve('react-refresh/babel'),\n              ].filter(Boolean),\n            },\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    // ... other plugins\n    isDevelopment && new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),\n    isDevelopment && new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin(),\n  ].filter(Boolean),\n  // ... other configuration options\n};\n```\n\nYou might want to further tweak the configuration to accommodate your setup:\n\n- `isDevelopment`\n\n  In this example we've shown the simple way of splitting up `development` and `production` builds with the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.\n  It will default to `true` (i.e. `development` mode) when `NODE_ENV` is not available from the environment.\n\n  In practice though, you might want to wire this up differently,\n  like [using a function config](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-a-function) or using multiple configuration files.\n\n- `webpack.HotModuleReplacamentPlugin`\n\n  If you use `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-plugin-serve`,\n  you can set `devServer.hot`/`devServer.hotOnly` and `hmr` to `true` respectively,\n  instead of adding the HMR plugin to your plugin list.\n\n> Note: If you are using TypeScript (instead of Babel) as a transpiler, you will still need to use `babel-loader` to process your source code.\n> Check out this [sample project](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin/tree/main/examples/typescript-without-babel) on how to set this up.\n\n### Integration Support for Overlay\n\nOfficially, `webpack-dev-server`, `webpack-hot-middleware` and `webpack-plugin-serve` aer supported out of the box -\nyou just have to set the [`overlay.sockIntegration`](docs/API.md#sockintegration) option to match what you're using.\n\nFor each of the integrations listed above,\nyou can also take a look at the corresponding [sample projects](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin/tree/main/examples) for a better understanding of how things should be wired up.\n\n## API\n\nPlease refer to [the API docs](docs/API.md) for all available options.\n\n## FAQs and Troubleshooting\n\nPlease refer to [the Troubleshooting guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for FAQs and resolutions to common issues.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the [MIT License](/LICENSE).\n\n## Related Work\n\n- [Initial Implementation by @maisano](https://gist.github.com/maisano/441a4bc6b2954205803d68deac04a716)\n",
